# Praktis-Group-Project
Update:
- All frontend aspects are moved into client/ directory
- Added backend logic (in server/ directory; Haven't been thoroughly reviewed, though most of them works in Postman)

What we do next:
1. Review backend functionality thoroughly and do some patches whenever a misalignment occurs
2. Integrate backend with the frontend
3. Deploy on a web hosting provider
4. Testing
